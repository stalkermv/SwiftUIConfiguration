# Contributing to SwiftUIConfiguration

Hey! Thanks for checking this out! 👋

## Found a Bug? 🐛

Just [open an issue](https://github.com/stalkermv/SwiftUIConfiguration/issues/new) and tell me:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- How to reproduce it

That's it! No need for formal bug reports.

## Want to Contribute? 🚀

Awesome! Here's how:

1. **Fork and clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SwiftUIConfiguration.git
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Add features, fix bugs, improve docs - whatever!
   - Run `swift test` to make sure tests pass
   - Add tests if you're adding new features

3. **Send a PR**
   - Push to your fork
   - Open a pull request
   - I'll review it ASAP

That's all! No complicated process.

## Code Style

Just try to match the existing code style:
- Use Apple naming conventions
- Add doc comments (`///`) for public APIs
- Keep it clean and readable

If something's unclear, just ask in the PR!

## Running Tests

```bash
swift build  # Make sure it compiles
swift test   # Run the 40 tests
```

## Questions?
